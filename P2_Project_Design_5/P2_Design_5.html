      <h2>1. Administrative Details</h2>
      <p>Client Name: Rob Boss</p>
      <p>Website Name: Joy of Picturing</p>
    </div>

    <div class="box">
      <h2>2. Purpose, goals and audience</h2>
      <p>
        The purpose of the website is to display a gallery of images that Rob has taken, and make it possible to buy
        various prints of these images. The website should make the customer interested in buying the pictures.
        We want to make it possible to contact the photographer, see the prices and purchase pictures.

        The target audience of the webpage are people who are looking for quality photographs. Whether they just like
        to browse, find background images for their phone, or are looking to make their living room a tiny bit less boring,
        this site will help them achieve their goal.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="box">
      <h2>3. Navigation Structure</h2>
      <p>
        Every page of Rob's website will contain a navigation bar with links to every other page, except
        for the shop page. This page is only accessible from the gallery after the user chooses a picture
        they wish to buy. However, since the navigation bar will be present on the shop page, it is possible
        to navigate to all other pages from this one.
      </p>
      <p>
        We settled on this site structure because we wanted the customer to easily navigate from one page
        to any other page. For example: If a customer sees a picture he likes, but wants information about what
        different print sizes would cost, he should not have to go back to the homepage to find a link to the
        price guidelines page. Other than the gallery and the shop page, none of the pages are especially related
        to each other. Therefore, we decided it would not make sense to use a strictly linear or hierarchical
        site structure.

      <h2>4. Page Layout and Appearance</h2>
      <p>
          The goal when making the website's universal design, was to make the pages look as simple and clean
          as possible. The design should also be easy to understand, with buttons leading you to the page you expected.
          We want to have Rob's photographs in focus and make the users interested in buying them,
          so the website's design should not grab the attention of the users, but serve as a good looking and
          functional foundation.
      </p>
      <figure>
          <img src="img/mockup.png" alt="Page Layout"/>
          <figcaption>Figure 2: Mockup of the Page Layout</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
          These are the specific universal styles we will use. Note that we have not added any sizes, because
          we won't know exactly what sizes work best until we actually make the website in HTML and CSS.
       </p>
      <ul>
          <li>Font: "Roboto". With fallback to "Arial" and "sans-serif". Size: 12px</li>
          <li>Colors:
              <ul>
                  <li>Text: Dark grey: #222222.</li>
                  <li>Background: Off-white: #fafaff.</li>
                  <li>Links: Desaturated blue: #5555ff.</li>
                  <li>Visited links: Desaturated purple: #a339a3</li>
              </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
              The body width will be 100% of the browser windows because we want pictures, for example on the homepage,
              to use the whole width of the window. Text will be placed in div elements with a smaller width.
          </li>
          <li>
              The navigation bar will be placed at the top of the page and be the same color as the body. It will use
              fixed position to always keep it on the top of the page. To separate it from the body we will use
              a box-shadow as a border. It will have four buttons linking to different pages on the right, and
              the name of the website on the left. We might make a logo to replace the website's name,
              and we will have it link to the homepage. The text in the navigation bar will be bold, and they will use
              CSS transitions to show the user when the button is active.
          </li>
          <li>
              At the bottom of the page we will have a footer with a Copyright warning. The footer will also have
              the same color as the body, but separated by a border with the color #aaaaaa. The footer should be pushed
              to the bottom of the page by all the other content.
          </li>

      </ul>

    </div>

    <div class="box">
      <h2>5. Content</h2>
      <p> The website will consist of five different pages: </p>
      <h3>Home: index.html</h3>

        <figure>
          <img src="img/homepage.png" alt="Price Guidelines"/>
          <figcaption>Figure 3: Homepage Mockup</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
            The homepage is the page first shown to the user when they go on the website. It will display the website's title
            and have a big slideshow covering the page, displaying a few pictures from the gallery, and fulfill the goal of
            intruiging the user to explore more of the webpage and potentially become a customer.
        </p>
        <p>It will fulfill the goal of </p>
      <h3>Gallery: gallery.html</h3>

          <figure>
            <img src="img/gallery_mockup.png" alt="Price Guidelines"/>
            <figcaption>Figure 4: Gallery Mockup</figcaption>
          </figure>

        <p>
            The gallery page will show Rob Boss' photographs. This will fulfill the goal of displaying Rob's photos and
            make the users interested in buying pictures. They will be displayed with three pictures in each row, and
            in a smaller resolution than the original files. More pictures should load while the user is scrolling
            down. By loading some pictures at a time, we hope to reduce the total loading times of the webpage.
            If the user clicks a photo, a window with a larger version of the picture should appear,
            along with a button for buying the picture and another one for going back to scrolling the gallery.
        </p>
      <h3>Shop: shop.html</h3>
          <figure>
            <img src="img/shopform.png" alt="Price Guidelines"/>
            <figcaption>Figure 5: Shop Form Mockup</figcaption>
          </figure>
        <p>
            The shop page will display a form for choosing the material and size for the print the customer wants
            to buy, and for the customers personal information required for shipping and billing. The page will fulfill
            the goal of being able to sell prints of Rob's pictures. When the form is filled out and the user clicks the
            submit button, the page will display a copy of the order details, telling the customer that their order is placed.
        </p>
      <h3>Price Guidelines: prices.html</h3>

        <figure>
          <img src="img/priceguidelines.png" alt="Price Guidelines"/>
          <figcaption>Figure 6: Price Guidelines Mockup</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          The price guidelines page will show a table of sizes and printable materials. It will fulfill the goal
          of making the user aware of the prices. The pictures can be printed on standard paper, photo paper,
          high quality paper, cardboard and durable silk poster material. If we have more time left after
          making the minimum requirements we will have a button that is going to change the size unit.
          Clicking the button will make the table switch between showing centimeters and inches.
        </p>

      <h3>About and Contact: about.html</h3>
          <figure>
            <img src="img/about.png" alt="Price Guidelines"/>
            <figcaption>Figure 7: About Mockup</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>
              The “About” page will inform the customer about contact info, Rob Boss, his work and the store. It will
              fulfill the goal of making it possible to contact Rob Boss, and information about the photographer might
              intrigue potential customers to buy a print from him.
          </p>
          <p>
              The page will use the universal page layout like the other pages. It should be easy to distinguish the
              section about Rob Boss, and the section about the store/webpage itself. Additionally the contact info
              should be easily accessible, therefore we will place it at the top of the page.
              There will also be an image of Rob Boss placed next to the text-section about him. The «about Rob Boss»
              section will be located beneath the contact info section, and the «about us» section will be below
              «about Rob Boss». There will be headers which clearly distinguish the two parts.
          </p>
    </div>

    <div class="box">
      <h2>6. Minimum Requirements</h2>
      <p>To fulfill the minimum requirements we will make these Javascript applications:</p>
      <ol>
          <li>
            A Javascript function that allows the use of a submit form function, this will be used
            when the user wants to register/buy a picture from the gallery, the submit form
            function will also be used in the «contact info» section where a user can send an
            email to Rob Boss. When the user then presses submit the page will read the input
            and reply with a message.
          </li>
          <li>
            Another Javascript function is a gallery slideshow, this will be used on the home
            page. The pictures will be shown in a random fashion, this way we can show the
            users a preview of the pictures the gallery has to offer. This will intrigue the users so
            that they are more likely to be interested in buying a picture.
          </li>
          <li>
            A Javascript function that will enable a pop up window for the pictures in the gallery,
            this will be used so that the users can view the pictures in a greater detail.
            Additionally the pop up window will show a button to the picture with a buy/add to
            cart option.
          </li>
          <li>
            The gallery will have a lot of pictures, therefore we will use a Javascript function
            which will enable us to only load the pictures which are shown on the screen, and
            as the users scrolls down more pictures will be loaded. This is important for the
            page to initially load faster.
          </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
          We will also create a modularity Javascript function that adds a navigation bar and a footer.
      </p>
      <p>
          If we have a have time left we might add a Javascript function that converts the size unit in
          the price table to centimeters and inches.
      </p>
