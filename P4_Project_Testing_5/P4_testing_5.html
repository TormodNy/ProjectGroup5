      <h2>3. Tester Audience</h2>
      <p>
        To reach testers that are similar to the websites intended audience we contacted. The age range
        of the target audience is pretty wide, therefore we tried reaching out to audienes of all age
        groups. We also asked whether the tester would be interested in buying a picture from the website to
        determine if we had managed to reach out to the target audience. We tested the website live with our
        first tester, and had him give us live feedback while also answering our Google Form. As the feedback
        was live, we got to working on the bugs he found right away.
      </p>

      <p>
        Since we believe the service our website provides might be of interest to the majority of people,
        we sent our questionnaire to anyone we could think of. However, we did not manage to get as many responses as we wanted,
        but we will analyse with the responses we got.

      </figure>

      <p>
        As we can see from Figure 2, about 73% of our testers said they would either be interested in buying the service our website
        provides, or that they may be interested. This could mean that they are not looking for decoration or prints at the moment,
        but when they do, a website like this could be an option. These numbers confirm our hypothesis that the majority of people
        would be interested in our service.

      <h2>5. Feedback Summary</h2>
      <p>These are the questions we asked our testers about our website: </p>
      <figure>
          <img src="img/navigation.png" alt="Navigation"/>
          <figcaption>Figure 4: Diagram displaying how easily our users navigated our website.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
          Our testers generally found it relatively easy to navigate our site with over 60% saying it was very easy to navigate.
          18% found it neither easy nor hard, and another 18% said it was easy. Noone answered that is was hard to navigate.
      </p>

      <figure>
          <img src="img/design.png" alt="Design"/>
          <figcaption>Figure 5: Diagram displaying how pleasing our testers found the website's design.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
            The average score of our website's design was 4.3, with over 45% giving it a perfect score. 18% of our testers
            gave our design a score of 3 out of 5, and 36% said it was a 4. Similarly to the navigations question, none of our testers
            thought the website's design was displeasing.
      </p>

      <figure>
          <img src="img/overallExperience.png" alt="Overall Experience"/>
          <figcaption>Figure 6: Diagram displaying our testers overall experience of the website.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
            On the question about the overall experience of the website, over 90% of our testers answered either 4 or 5 out of 5.
            Only one person answered 3, and noone answered 1 or 2.
      </p>

      <figure>
          <img src="img/bugs.png" alt="Bugs"/>
          <figcaption>Figure 7: Diagram displaying how many of our testers encountered any bugs or unfunctionalities.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
          Only one person out of the 11 testers encountered anything that could be considered a bug or unfunctionality.
      </p>

      <p>
          At the bottom of the questionnaire, we asked for any other comments. Out of all 11 testers, only one person actually gave further feedback, and they wrote:
          <br /><br />
          <i>The front page could be something, because when I first click on the website it kind of looks like it’s still loading, since there are nothing that fills the front page.</i>
          <br /><br />
          We will take a look at these test answers in the next section.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="box">
      <h2>6. Your Response</h2>
      <p>
          We are for the most part satisfied with the responses we have got from our testers. The answers show that in general,
          our site is easy to navigate, looks good and the users have a positive overall experience testing our site. However, we
          would have liked to have gotten more comments describing in detail what they liked and did not like. It would be very helpful
          if for example, the two people that answered that the website was neither hard nor easy to navigate, had given us some insight
          into why they answered this. Without these detailed answers it is hard to fix or improve on it.
      </p>

      <p>
          We did however, recieve one such comment indicating that it seems the homepage was still loading, since no content appeared.
          Though it is possible that the tester had a bad internet connection, or that the website did not fully work on his platform, we
          realize our front page, upon loading, doesn't show a lot of content. Only the navigation bar, a background image that fills the screen
          and an arrow, prompting the user to scroll down, appears. It is possible that the tester only saw a big background image, and not the
          arrow, and therefore thought the frontpage had no other content. To fix this we could make the arrows animation more visible and eye-catching,
          as well as add some text telling the user to scroll down. We could also change the design of the homepage a bit, by adding more content already
          visible from opening the page.
      </p>

      <p>
          The tester that answered that they had encountered a bug, was one of the first testers we had, and one of the participants
          we did live testing with. He found that the footer on the "About" page, was floating over the bottom of the screen. We have fixed
          the footer before delivering our project. The same test subject helped test our site in detail, and gave us great feedback.
          We could see that he had no problem navigating the site, and he also had a positive overall impression.
      </p>

      <p>
          We also got a few comments of people wondering whether the latin text littered through the website was intended or not. Since almost none
          of our testers have any experience with web development it is not surprising that they are unfamiliar with "Lorem ipsum" filler text.
          We probably should have notified them beforehand about it's use, or written some proper text before testing.

      <h2>7. Self-reflection</h2>
      <p>
          We think that this project has been very helpful,
          before this some of us had no experience in HTML, CSS or JavaScript.
          Therefore working on this project has been very insightful for our learning.
          In addition, working in a group also helped us because we could ask the each others for
          help if we needed it. Other than HTML, CSS and JavaScript this project also helped us learn and
          work with git and github, which are two very helpful tools.

          From working on the project we have learned several things about working in groups. We have seen that planning
          everything out on beforehand is a huge help. However, this only helps if we follow the plan we made, and this
          was not always the case. We got more ideas and pushed the tasks over the deadlines.
          The new ideas was often extra things to be added onto the existing plan. They take more time,
          more research and delayed working on the core of the website, which is the requirements described in the design document.
          This resulted in much of the work happening in the last week, when we had scheduled starting the testing. We also underestimated
          the amount of small things that would pop up during development that suddenly needed fixing, and how much time this would take.

          This might sound extremely bad, but the total workload was not that big, so we managed to complete everything at an acceptable time.
          It is not as much about how much we had to do, but how much work could have been avoided, and distributed more evenly on the
          time we had available. In summary, we learned the importance of having a plan and sticking to it. Then, after the website's core is finished
          we can add new ideas and functionalities without delaying or interfering with the original plan.
