      <h2>3. Tester Audience</h2>
      <p> To reach testers that are similar to the websites intended audience we contacted. The age range
      of the target audience is pretty wide, therefore we tried reaching out to audienes of all age 
      groups. We also asked whether the tester would be interested in buying a picture from the website to 
      determine if we had managed to reach out to the target audience. We tested the website live with our
      first tester, and had him give us live feedback while also answering our Google Form. As the feedback
      was live, we got to working on the bugs he found right away. </p>
