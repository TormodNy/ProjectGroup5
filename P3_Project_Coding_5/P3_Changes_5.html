      <h2>Design Changes</h2>

      <h3>General changes</h3>
      <p>
          We added a logo on the left side of the navigation bar, replacing the text that was shown in the mockups.
      </p>

      <h3>Changes to index.html: </h3>
      <p>
            Instead of displaying the websites title in a big font, it displays one of the pictures covering the screen.
            There's an arrow at the bottom that prompts the user to scroll down, where he/she is greeted by more information
            and more pictures. Also, instead of having the slideshow cover the whole page, we have a separate section further
            down on the page containing the slideshow that also links to the gallery page.
      </p>

      <h3>Changes to gallery.html: </h3>
      <p>
            There are no changes to the display of the gallery.
      </p>

      <h3>Changes to shop.html: </h3>
      <p>
          In the shop page, the prices page, and the about page we decided to add background images.
          This was to make the webpage more stylish and pleasant to look at. We did not include the line which
          separated product information and customer information shown in the mockup. Other than this
          we followed layout of the mockup.
      </p>

      <h3>Changes to prices.html: </h3>
      <p>
          As previously mentioned we changed added a background picture the prices page. We decided not to have a
          button for converting units, but added an interactive tool that calculates the price given by frame material,
          print material and size.
      </p>

      <h3>Changes to about.html: </h3>
      <p>
          As mentioned earlier we decided to add a background image to several of the pages, including about.html. We also decided
          to not have a contact form, but instead listed the contact information. For the rest of the page we followed the layout
          of the mockup.
      </p>

      <h3>Changes to 1. required JS, shopForm.js:</h3>
      <p>
          The submit function is not changed much from the design, but we decided not to use it on the contact page, and instead
          we just listed the necessary contact information with a 'mailto' link. When the user submits the form he is prompted
          with a message saying the order was successful and shown the information he put into the form.
      </p>

      <h3>Changes to 2. required JS, slideshow.js:</h3>
      <p>
          We haven't made any big changes to the slideshow. It consists of two elements where one of them fades in and
          out using CSS animations.
      </p>

      <h3>Changes to 3. required JS, gallery.js (previously picturePopUp.js):</h3>
      <p>
          Changed the popup window so that it contains text in addition to the buttons for purchasing the picture and
          exiting the popup window. Apart from that no further changes were made.
      </p>

      <h3>Changes to 4. required JS, gallery.js (previously galleryLoader.js):</h3>
      <p>
          The galleryloader starts adding the pictures to website as while the page is loading. When scrolling down it will
          add more and more pictures up to a certain threshold. These pictures are the same 14 images, but are selected randomly.
          This is because we used a limited number of pictures, but the function can be changed to continue showing new photos
          if there are more to show.
      </p>

      <h3>Added a 5. JS, prices.js:</h3>
      <p>
          Added prices.js that calculates the total price of the print from the user input using a form.
      </p>

      <h3>Modularity</h3>
      <p>
          We used Javascript to add modularity to the webpage. The JS file 'modularity.js' appends a navigation bar to the top
          of the page and a footer to the bottom. We decided to make a custom function called 'makeElement' to shorten the process
          of creating elements.
      </p>
