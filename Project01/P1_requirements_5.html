      <h2>Our Client</h2>
      <b>Client Name: Rob Boss</b>
      <p>
        Rob is a 56 year old hobby-photographer from Florida, USA. He is the host of the not-so-popular television program 'The Joy of Picturing'.
        Because of a minimal profit from television he now wants to share and sell his work online.

        The purpose of the website is to display a gallery of images that Rob has taken, and make it possible to buy various prints of these images.
        We want to make it possible to contact the photographer, see the prizes and purchase pictures.
